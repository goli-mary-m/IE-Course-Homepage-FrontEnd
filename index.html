                        JavaScript is the programming language of the web and is used by more software developers today
                        than any other programming language. For nearly 25 years this best seller has been the go-to guide
                        for JavaScript programmers. The seventh edition is fully updated to cover the 2020 version of 
                        JavaScript, and new chapters cover classes, modules, iterators, generators, Promises, async/await,
                        and metaprogramming. You'll find illuminating and engaging example code throughout.
                        <br />
                        This book is for programmers who want to learn JavaScript and for web developers who want to take
                        their understanding and mastery to the next level. It begins by explaining the JavaScript language 
                        itself, in detail, from the bottom up. It then builds on that foundation to cover the web platform 
                        and Node.js.

                        In "The Road to React" you will learn about all the fundamentals of React.js
                        with Hooks while building a full-blown React application step by step. 
                        While you create the React application, every chapter will introduce you to a new 
                        React key feature. However, there is more than only the fundamentals: The book 
                        dives into related topics (e.g. React with TypeScript, Testing, Performance Optimizations)
                        and advanced feature implementations like client- and server-side searching. 
                        At the end of the book, you will have a fully working deployed React application.
